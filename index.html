        <h2 class="title">Background</h2>
        <p>I am a new web designer who is eager to learn as much as I can about the web. Since I stumbled upon the amazing world of web development I haven't been able to get enough of it. I love learning and I love being challenged and as of yet haven't been able to find anything that makes both of those possible for me like building websites has.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2 class="title">Goals</h2>
        <p>There isn't a programming language that I don't want to learn, but for now I am focused on becoming proficient in front-end web development and mastering:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'd love to work for a company building websites for clients, or to go into business myself creating and maintaing my own amazing websites!</p>
